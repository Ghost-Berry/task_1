<p>Hi, my name is Osaid. I will soon begin my 4th year studying computer engineering 
    at An-Najah University. I am from Salfit, specifically Al-Zawiya. I 
    joined this course to improve my web programming skills.
</p>
<p>
    I have completed courses in data structures with OOP, Java, databases, C, and 
    C++. I know a little about JavaScript but have no experience with web 
    development, which is why I took this course. I also saw topics that are
    particularly interesting for computer engineers.
</p>
<p>
    I would like to thank our professor, Tariq, for presenting the material in a
    simplified and understandable manner.
</p>
